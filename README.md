"Clusters of behavior push us towards complicated tests with a lot of duplication. If we can isolate the parts from each other, 
then we can avoid the combinatoric explosion in the number of tests that we need to write. 

Here we start re-implementing the "sell one item" feature using Client-First Design and Mock Objects. 

You'll see over the coming series that mock objects don't have to lead to hyperactive, brittle tests that restrict refactoring. 

On the contrary, we will use mocks to give us timely and uncompromising feedback about the health (or not) of the dependencies among modules."

The original code is Java, but the repo, I've used Typescript for the implementation
